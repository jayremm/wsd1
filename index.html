         <p>So now that you have seen Lux let me tell you more about the game and what Lux does in the game.</p>

    <h3>LOL</h3>
    
  
    <p><em>League Of Legends</em> is a free game you can download it <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">here.</a> The game is a multiplayer vs game. 5vs5 or 3vs3. Their are a ton of champions to choose from and the teams objective is to destroy the enemy Nexus and at the same time defend your own. It sounds easy but in order to get to the enemy&rsquo;s Nexus you have to push trough Minions and Towers while fighting 5 other champions that want to defend their Nexus. So it is not easy. Games can last up to 1 hour and some last a few minutes, depending on the game mode and the opposing team.</p>

    <h3>Now Lux</h3>
  
    <p>	Lux is a mage support charcter.</p>
  <section>
    <p>	Her main role is AP. Which is ability power. Ability power makes her abilities stronger, weather they do damage to opposing champions or support her allies. Being a mage range character AP is recommended for her to be good. Some people like to give her health and mana items and their is nothing wrong with this, but a build of health and mana items will lack AP builds. The way I build Lux is, AP, mana, and def. Some defence items will offer some health while others do not. Haveing a good def will insure u to stay alive during team fights to protect your base from the opposing team.</p>
  </section>
      <aside>
        <p>Lux, in my <strong>opinion</strong>, is the best champion to use. Every champion differs from the other and it’s all about personal preference. Some people prefer to use support roles, others prefer to do a lot of damage and carry the team. Whatever you prefer or think you will prefer it’s best to try out a few champions before buying one. They are not all easy to use and some will turn out to be a waist of influence points if you don’t like them.</p>
